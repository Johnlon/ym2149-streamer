Title: ym2149-streamer

The ym2149-streamer allows sending Atari ST YM files to a YM2149 chip
driven by an Arduino.


I'm using a Windows machine so things are a little complicated.
USB support isn't native in WSL2 so there's messing around I can't be bothered with.
So I'll use WSL2 for the bits that are best done on Linux and use Windows for all the USB/Comm port stuff.

How to build the Arduino Hex file
=======

Built on Linux - I use WSL2.

Requirements
------------

The following libraries are required:

* gcc-avr
* avr-libc
* avrdude

Build Hex file
------------

    $ make


Upload to Arduino Nano
================

Do on Windows.

A Windows copy of 'avrdude' is sitting in this dir for convenience and program.bat is configured to upload the hex file to an Arduino nano.

    $ program.bat
